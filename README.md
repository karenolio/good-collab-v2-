===============

Good Collab is something I’ve wanted to work on since college. It is a platform that helps source answers to questions posed by non-profits. I think that experiences gained from working on projects / volunteering or living abroad may help provide better insight and deeper understanding to those working on a project that is based abroad but lack the resources to conduct on-the-ground research. The platform's goal is to allow knowledge holders to share information that they possess which may therefore, help lower the chances of an initiative from failing. 

goal
bring down the barrier to information by inviting people to chime in. we can crowdsource for answers and insight, and solicit explanations from all over the world for solutions to things for a good cause. 

there are many people who possess knowledge that can be useful to npos. it would be helpful for npos to have access to this information that can help them make better decisions in the projects they’re working on.

it would be great if there was a way for people from different backgrounds (such as professors, urban planners, researchers, economists, designers, physical therapists, etc.) to help offer answers, advice and support to questions that nonprofits may run into when planning, carrying out and closing projects. through this type of collaboration, nonprofits can find the answers they need with more ease and with more information, they can understand what help is really needed and/or what certain situations really require and allocate resources better.

about
there are many npos and ngos that could benefit from a platform that allows for a free flowing exchange of advice, insight and information. this platform allows the opportunity for communication/knowledge exchange between those who possess knowledge (professors, urban planners, and researchers, etc.) and those that would benefit from their knowledge. 

this form of collaboration can also be beneficial to those who volunteer their knowledge - a great sense of fulfillment can come from knowing that sharing their knowledge can lead to social progression and inspire more people to give back to the community.

background 
two years ago, two friends and i looked to start a non-profit that would provide education to students in east africa.
i was a senior in college, and my friends were two recent graduates, though we each had experiences volunteering/interning for npos and ngos, but didn’t know what it involved to start one. our only resource was the internet - to find answers to questions such as “what is the existing education system like in tanzania?”, “what are the standards of local teachers?”, “what are the costs of attending school?” and “why aren’t there more children going to school?”, etc.

these initial questions we raised eventually led to even deeper and more complicated questions that google simply had no answer to. i thought perhaps we could contact locals in tanzania, such as phd students or instructors in universities who might be able to give us further insight but did not know where to start. 

why is this important?
limited budgets and other constraints tend to also mean lack of support and/or formal research on a project. this lack of information can be challenging for new nonprofits to form or current non-profits to expand their impact.
